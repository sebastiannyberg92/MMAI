# MMAI

Purpose:

- Implement a reverb algorithm in C/C++.

What should the project do:
- Our program has to:
  - read wav files
  - play them in real time withe reverberation effect on it
  
The implementation should have controls for:
- a dry-wet
- early reflections
- a late reverberation size
- a spectral control (damping or equalizer)

Our program has to:
- have a CLI
- be runnable on at least Linux

Libraries that have to be used for sound file and audio I/O:
- libsndfile
- portaudio

# Milestones

Week 15: project plan
- What have we researched about the reverbs?
- How will we implement a reverb?
- interface description
- base algorithm

How will we share the work between us?
- tasks
- responsability
- schedule
