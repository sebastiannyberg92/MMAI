# MMAI

Purpose:

- Implement a reverb algorithm in C/C++.

What should the project do:
- Our program has to:
  - read wav-files
  - play them in real time withe reverberation effect on it
  
The implementation should have controls for:
- a dry-wet
- early reflections
- a late reverberation size
- a spectral control (damping or equalizer)

Our program has to:
- have a CLI
- be runnable on at least Linux

Libraries that have to be used for sound file and audio I/O:
- libsndfile
- portaudio

# Milestones

Week 15: project plan
- What have you researched about reverbs yourself?
- How are you going to implement a reverb? (interface description, base algorithm, etc.) 
- How will the group work be organized? (Tasks, responsibility, schedule, etc.)
